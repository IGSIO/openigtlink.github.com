## 3D Slicer and OpenIGTLink Tutorial
> Web Page: [3D Slicer 4.2 Training Page](http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/4.2/Training#OpenIGTLink).
3D Slicer is a free, open source software package for visualization and image analysis. The package comes with
an integrated OpenIGTLink interface that allows you to exchange various types of data such as position tracking data and
image data with external tools. The 3D Slicer training page provides a series of courses for learning how to use 3D Slicer version 4.
The portfolio contains self-guided presentation and sample data sets.
Reference manual style documentation for Slicer4 can be found on the Slicer Wiki.
Contact [Sonia Pujol, Ph.D.](http://www.spl.harvard.edu/pages/People/spujol), if you have any question regarding the 3D Slicer tutorial.


## Using OpenIGTLink from 3D Slicer Python Interface
> Web page: [3D Slicer OpenIGTLink Developer's Information Page](http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/OpenIGTLinkIF)
With 3D Slicer, you can write your own IGT application as a plug-in module using
[Python scripting language](http://www.python.org). The OpenIGTLink Developer's
Information Page demonstrates how to control data streaming through the OpenIGTLink
interface in 3D Slicer. 


## Develop Software with OpenIGTLink Library
> Web page: [OpenIGTLink Library Tutorial](http://www.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/OpenIGTLink/Library/Tutorial)
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to use [The OpenIGTLink Library](library.html) for your
software development using the C/C++ language. The library is available free of chage for any purpose, including commercial use.


## Integrating Your Matlab/Octave Script with 3D Slicer Using OpenIGTLink
> Web page: [OpenIGTLink Matlab](tutorials/matlabigtl.html)
This tutorial shows how to use the OpenIGTLink interface for Matlab/Octave. The interface allows
your Matlab script to exchange linear transform and image data with 3D Slicer over the network.
