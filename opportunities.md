## Call for Paper: Special Issue on Image-guided Intelligent Intervention 
> Web page: [Journal of Medical Robotics Research](http://www.worldscientific.com/page/jmrr/callforpapers01)

Deadline is extended to July 31, 2015.

Journal of Medical Robotics Research (JMRR) seeks articles for a Special Issue on Image-guided Intelligent Interventions. There has been significant research in the past few years on integrating multimodal image-guidance with intelligent instrumentation and robotics to provide context-specific information to the interventionalist while improving the precision and accuracy of the procedures. We are now at a point where such intelligent image-guidance is becoming a reality. The goal of this special issue is to highlight the technical and clinical challenges in designing and developing systems and algorithms for enabling image-guided intelligent interventions.
